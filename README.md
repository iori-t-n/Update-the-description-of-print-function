# Update-the-syntax-of-print-function-in-HTML
This is a practice project in the MOOC "Python Data Representations" by Rice university on Coursera.

"print" is a function in Python 3 unlike Python 2.  This program wrote in Python 3 automatically updates the HTML for Python 2 documentations such that almost all of the examples use correct Python 3 syntax for print (i.e. the arguments are enclosed in parentheses).
